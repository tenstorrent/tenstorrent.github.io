## Galaxy Wormhole Power Supply Specifications

Tenstorrent Galaxy Wormhole 4U Servers are shipped with one (1) Galaxy Wormhole Power Supply containing six (6) Murata MWOCP68-3600-B-RM Power Supply Modules for every two (2) Galaxy Wormhole 4U Servers. The data sheet for the Murata Power Supply Module can be downloaded from Murata in PDF form [here](https://www.murata.com/-/media/webrenewal/products/power/datasheet/mwocp68-3600-b-rm.ashx?la=en&cvid=20230314020000000000).

Under peak load of two (2) Galaxy Wormhole 4U Servers, the Galaxy Wormhole Power Supply will only require five (5) of the individual power supply modules. In practice, this makes the Galaxy Wormhole Power Supply a 5+1 redundant power supply, though most customer configurations can likely handle two or more supplies failing without bringing down the Galaxy Wormhole 4U Server(s). The power supply modules are also hot-swappable.

## Board Management Controller (BMC)

The Board Management Controller (BMC) utilizes a single IMX8 module mounted to the bottom side of the motherboard PCB. There must be allocation on the user’s network for an IP address associated with the module and it should be connected to the same network as the rack management software.

The BMC can report the following system parameters:

- Power per Galaxy Module
- Individual power reports from internal power modules
- Temperatures across Galaxy Wormhole 4U Server
- Fan Speed

## High-Speed Interconnectivity

![galaxy_interconnect_diagram](./images/galaxy_interconnect_diagram.png)

Each Galaxy Module is connected via four (4) 100GbE Ethernet links to adjacent Galaxy Modules. Modules close to the front and back panels have two (2) 100GbE connections to the QSFP-DD Ethernet ports, enabling connectivity to other Galaxy Wormhole 4U Server systems or the Host Computer within or outside of the rack.
