# Specifications/Requirements

## Wormhole™ Tensix Processor

The Wormhole™ n150s and n300s Tensix Processor add-in boards are built using the Tenstorrent Wormhole™ Tensix Processor:

- **Tensix Core Count:** 80
- **SRAM:** 120MB (1.5MB per Tensix Core)
- **Memory:** 12GB GDDR6, 192-bit memory bus

## n150s/n300s/n300d Comparison Table

**NOTE:** The **n150s and n300s add-in cards** come with a heatsink for passive cooling in systems which can provide sufficient forced airflow to the card. If your system does not (for example, a desktop workstation), installing the [Active Cooling Kit](../ack.md) is **required**. If the card isn’t sufficiently cooled, performance will be  substantially reduced to stay in a safe operating temperature range and you risk damage to the card.

## Connectivity

The n150s and n300s include two different methods for interconnecting cards.

![](./images/wh_portspec.png)

The Warp 100 notches are for attaching internal [Warp 100 bridges](..\warp100.md) between n150s and n300s cards.

The two QSFP-DD ports support QSFP-DD 400GbE connectivity between cards and/or the Galaxy Wormhole 4U Server.

## Data Precision Formats

The n150/n300 support the following data precision formats:

| Format               | Bit Depth                               |
