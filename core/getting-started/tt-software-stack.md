## **TT-Forge™: The MLIR-Based Compiler**

TT-Forge™ is Tenstorrent's Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)-based compiler. It bridges high-level machine learning frameworks with the Tenstorrent software stack.

Interact with TT-Forge™ to compile models from frameworks such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) for execution on Tenstorrent hardware. It offers an automated, general path to run many types of model architectures without requiring custom kernel development. TT-Forge™ integrates with and lowers to TT-Metalium for hardware execution.

The main project is located in the [tt-forge](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge) GitHub repository.

## **TT-NN™: A Python & C++ Neural Network OP library**

TT-NN™ is a library of neural network operations that provides a user-friendly interface for running models on Tenstorrent hardware. It is designed to be intuitive for developers familiar with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).

Interact with TT-NN™ to run AI models using a familiar, high-level Python API without managing the complexities of the underlying hardware. TT-NN™ builds upon TT-Metalium™ and provides a stable set of pre-packaged, optimized operations. It is also available with a C++ API.

The TT-NN™ library is part of the [tt-metal](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal) GitHub repository.

## **TT-Metalium™: Programming Tenstorrent Hardware**
TT-Metalium™ is the low-level, open-source software development kit (SDK) that provides developers direct access to Tenstorrent hardware. It is a bare-metal programming environment designed for users who must write custom C++ kernels for machine learning or other high-performance computing workloads.

Interact with TT-Metalium™ when you require complete control over the hardware to optimize code for performance, explicitly manage memory, or implement novel operations not found in standard libraries. This environment exposes the RISC-V processors, the Network-on-Chip (NoC), and the matrix and vector engines within each Tensix core.

The main project is available in the [tt-metal](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal) GitHub repository.
