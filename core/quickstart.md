## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A **compatible host machine** with minimum hardware and OS requirements as specified by each product's minimum system requirements:
  - [Add-In Boards / Cards](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/aibs/index.html)
  - [Systems](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/systems/index.html)
- **Network access** to download software packages.
- **Administrator privileges** on the host machine.

***NOTE**: The recommended OS for all Tenstorrent software is **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)**. Each SDK may support newer distributions of Ubuntu; however, compatibility should be considered experimental at this time.*

## 2. Unboxing and Hardware Setup

1. **Unpack the hardware** and check all components against the provided list.
2. **Install the hardware** following the hardware installation manual and safety guidelines by product:
    - [Add-In Boards / Cards](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/aibs/index.html)
    - [Systems](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/systems/index.html)
3. **Secure the hardware** in place, ensuring it is firmly seated and all connections are stable.

## 3. Software Installation

To interact with the Tensix Processor(s), youâ€™ll need to install the system-level dependencies and SDK on your host machine.

Each software package is organized into separate repositories hosted publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenstorrent).

**Important!**

This Starting Guide will reference each software utility where the latest version is available. However, each SDK will have it's own compatibility matrix associated with each release. It is strongly recommended to consult each SDK's release compatibility matrix to ensure you are installing the correct versions of the system software packages.

### Step 1: Install the Driver (TT-KMD)

Navigate to the [TT-KMD](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-kmd) homepage and follow instructions within the README.

### Step 2: Device Firmware Update (TT-Flash / TT-Firmware)

The [TT-Firmware](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-firmware) file needs to be installed using the [TT-Flash](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-flash) utility. For more details, visit the [TT-Flash homepage](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-flash?tab=readme-ov-file#firmware-files:~:text=Firmware%20files,of%20the%20images.) and follow instructions within the README.

### Step 3: Setup HugePages

```bash
# Ensure packages installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wget git

# Clone System Tools Repo
git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-system-tools.git
cd tt-system-tools
chmod +x hugepages-setup.sh
sudo ./hugepages-setup.sh

# Install `.deb`
wget https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-system-tools/releases/download/upstream%2F1.1/tenstorrent-tools_1.1-5_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i tenstorrent-tools_1.1-5_all.deb

# Start Services
sudo systemctl enable --now tenstorrent-hugepages.service
sudo systemctl enable --now 'dev-hugepages\x2d1G.mount'

# System Reboot
sudo reboot
```

***NOTE:** This is a temporary solution for configuring hugepages. If the above fails, please check the latest available release from [TT-System-Tools](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-system-tools.git).*

### Step 4: Install the System Management Interface (TT-SMI)

Navigate to [TT-SMI](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-smi) homepage and follow instructions within the README.

### Step 5: (Optional) Multi-Card Configuration (TT-Topology)

If you are running on a TT-LoudBox or TT-QuietBox system, please navigate to the [TT-Topology](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-topology) homepage and follow instructions within the README.

### Step 6: Verify System Configuration

Once the hardware and system software are installed, verify that your system has been configured properly.

Run the `tt-smi` utility.

This should bring up a display that looks as below.

This is the default mode where the user can see device information, telemetry, and firmware.

### Step 7: SDK Installation

Tenstorrent provides three SDKs for developing on Tensix Processors:

- [TT-Buda](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-buda)
- [TT-Metalium/TT-NN](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal)
- [TT-Forge/TT-MLIR](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge-fe)

Each SDK will have it's own system dependency requirements and installation process.

To help you get started, we have provided *First 5 Things* guides, which include installation steps, for TT-Buda and TT-Metalium.

- [First 5 Things](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-buda-demos/tree/main/first_5_steps) for **TT-Buda**, our open source, high level SDK
- [First 5 Things](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/ttnn/latest/ttnn/get_started.html) for **TT-Metalium/TT-NN**, our open source, low level SDK
