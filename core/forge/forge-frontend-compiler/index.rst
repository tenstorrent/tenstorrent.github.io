TT-Forge Frontend Compiler
=======================================
TT-Forge offers three different frontend compilers, making it easy to work with a model from almost any framework. These compilers take a high-level model and convert it into Tenstorrent's internal graph IR. The frontend compilers include:

* TT-Torch - for models using PyTorch
* TT-XLA - for models using something from the XLA ecosystem like JAX or TensorFlow
* TT-Forge-FE - a general-purpose compiler that's framework-agnostic and able to support multiple input formats (ONNX, TorchScript, custom graph format)
