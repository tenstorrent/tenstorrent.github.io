TT-Forge Backend Compiler
=======================================
tt-mlir is the backend compiler for tt-forge. It takes a Tenstorrent-specific graph intermediate representation (IR) that was created by one of the tt-forge frontends (tt-forge-fe, tt-torch, or tt-xla) and lowers it into Tenstorrent hardware-specific code using the MLIR framework.
