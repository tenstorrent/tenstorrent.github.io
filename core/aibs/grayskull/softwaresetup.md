# Software Setup

Once the e75/e150 card is installed, you'll need to follow these steps in this order to update the firmware  and install the necessary utilities to get the most from your Grayskull™ card.



## Install Driver

### Prerequisite

You must have DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) installed. In the terminal, enter the command appropriate to your Linux distro.

| Linux Distro           | Command                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Debian, Ubuntu         | `apt install dkms`                             |
| Fedora                 | `dnf install dkms`                             |
| Enterprise Linux based | `dnf install epel-release && dnf install dkms` |

### Installation

Install the driver (**<u>TT-KMD</u>**) by entering this series of commands in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-kmd.git
cd tt-kmd
git checkout -b ttkmd-1.26 ttkmd-1.26
sudo dkms add .
sudo dkms install tenstorrent/1.26
sudo modprobe tenstorrent
```



## Install TT-Flash

To install **<u>TT-Flash</u>**, the utility used to update firmware, enter this command in the terminal:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-flash.git
```

## Update Firmware

To update the firmware for your e75/e150 card, enter this series of commands in the terminal:

```
wget https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-firmware/raw/main/fw_pack-80.8.0.0.fwbundle
tt-flash --fw-tar fw_pack-80.8.0.0.fwbundle
```

If this process worked, reboot the system and go to the next section. 

If running this last command results in an error that says the firmware is too old, enter the following command:

```
tt-flash --fw-tar fw_pack-80.8.0.0.fwbundle --force
```

Then reboot the system.
