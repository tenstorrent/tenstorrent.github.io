Participants that submit Accepted Contributions shall be eligible to earn a payout (a “<strong>Bounty</strong>”), as determined solely in Tenstorrent’s discretion, in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>These Terms include important clauses, including without limitation, instances where Participants may be liable to Tenstorrent, a class action waiver, and other limitations of your rights and remedies. Disputes will be adjudicated solely in the courts of the State of California. By participating in the Program, all Participants must agree to be bound by these Terms and comply with these Terms. If an individual does not wish to, or cannot comply with these Terms, they are ineligible for a Bounty Payout and must not participate in the Program.</p>
