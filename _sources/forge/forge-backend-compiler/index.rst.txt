TT-Forge Backend Compiler
=======================================
TT-MLIR is the backend compiler for tt-forge. It takes a Tenstorrent-specific graph intermediate representation (IR) that was created by one of the TT-Forge frontends (TT-Forge-FE, TT-Torch, or TT-XLA) and lowers it into Tenstorrent hardware-specific code using the MLIR framework.
