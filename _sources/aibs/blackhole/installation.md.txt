# Hardware Installation
This document guides system administrators and users through the process of physically installing and connecting Tenstorrent Blackhole™ p100a, Blackhole™ p150a, and Blackhole™ p150b add-in boards into a host system. You will learn the necessary pre-installation steps, installation procedures for desktop workstations, and how to connect power.

---

## Pre-Installation

Before you begin the installation process, complete the following steps:

1. Disconnect power from the host computer.  
2. Verify that your system meets the following requirements:  
   * **PCI Express 5.0 x16 slot**: For optimal performance, the board requires a x16 configuration without bifurcation.  
     * Blackhole™ p100a and Blackhole™ p150a products are dual-slot width boards with active coolers. Tenstorrent recommends leaving the adjacent slot unoccupied to ensure optimal airflow.  
     * Blackhole™ p150b is a dual-slot width board with a passive heatsink, designed for rack-mounted systems with sufficient active airflow.
     :::{warning}
     An **ATX 3.1 Certified power supply** or better is required. Using an older or inadequate power supply may result in system instability.  
     :::
   * One (1) **12+4-pin 12V-2x6 power connector**.  
3. Discharge static electricity from your body by wearing an **ESD wrist strap** (*recommended*) or by touching a grounded surface before touching system components or the add-in board.
