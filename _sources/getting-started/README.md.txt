# Installing the Tenstorrent Software Stack

This guide assists users who have completed the physical hardware setup of their Tenstorrent system. You will learn how to install the Tenstorrent software stack, including system dependencies, drivers, and the TT-Metalium™ development environment, and how to verify the installation.

## **Before You Begin**

Before you begin the software installation, ensure your host machine meets the following prerequisites:

* The host machine has an internet connection to download software packages.  
* The host machine has a supported operating system installed (Supported OS listed below)
  * Tenstorrent also supports [other operating systems](#running-the-installer-script) but are considered experimental at this point
* You have administrator privileges on the host machine.
* The system is physically unboxed and set up according to your product's installation manual and safety guidelines.

### **Supported Operating Systems**

Tenstorrent recommends Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) for all Tenstorrent software. While each SDK may support newer distributions of Ubuntu, consider their compatibility experimental at this time.

### **BIOS Requirements**

The BIOS for your host motherboard should configure the PCIe AER Reporting Mechanism to be set to `OS First`. Tenstorrent's TT-SMI software requires this setting to function properly.

:::{important}
If you are using a TT-QuietBox, you do not have to worry about setting this option. It is set to `OS First` by default.

If you update or reset your BIOS for any reason, you must reconfigure the PCIe AER Reporting Mechanism setting to `OS First` to ensure TT-SMI functions correctly. This setting is typically located in the **Motherboard Information** section of your BIOS.

## **Running the Installer Script**

Tenstorrent recommends using the [tt-installer](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/) script to install the Tenstorrent software stack. This script automates the setup process and is compatible with Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian operating systems.

### **1\. Execute the installer**
The installer has two dependencies, `curl` and `jq`. Install them using your system package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl jq
```

Now, to begin the installation, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/releases/latest/download/install.sh)"
```

You will be prompted to select which software you wish to install. The first thing you will see looks like:
```
   __                  __                             __
  / /____  ____  _____/ /_____  _____________  ____  / /_
 / __/ _ \/ __ \/ ___/ __/ __ \/ ___/ ___/ _ \/ __ \/ __/
/ /_/  __/ / / (__  ) /_/ /_/ / /  / /  /  __/ / / / /_
\__/\___/_/ /_/____/\__/\____/_/  /_/   \___/_/ /_/\__/

[INFO] Welcome to tenstorrent!
[INFO] This is tt-installer version 1.6.0
[INFO] Log is at /tmp/tenstorrent_install_l2ULbx/install.log
[INFO] Using software versions:
[INFO]   TT-KMD: 2.3.0
[INFO]   Firmware: 18.7.0

```
**Answer "Y" to continue.**

### **2\. Grant Root Privileges**
Next, the installation will start and ask you to grant the script sudo permissions:
```
[INFO] Starting installation
[INFO] Checking for sudo permissions... (may request password)
[sudo] password for <your-username>: 
```
:::{admonition} Required
:class: warning
**Using sudo is required so you must enter your user's password.**
:::

### **3\. Install TT-Metalium Slim Container**
tt-installer configures necessary packages on your system and installs system-level tools as well as our programming framework, TT-Metalium. By default, TT-Metalium is installed as a container using Podman. This containerized environment is appropriate for most users as explained [here](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/wiki/Using-the-tt%E2%80%90metalium-container), but advanced users and developers may wish to install Metalium natively on the host system or use Docker instead of Podman. See [TT-NN / TT-Metalium Installation](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-metal/latest/tt-metalium/installing.html#tt-nn-tt-metalium-installation) for manual installation instructions.

Next, you will be prompted whether to install the TT-Metalium slim container:
```
[INFO] Would you like to install the TT-Metalium slim container?
[INFO] This container is appropriate if you only need to use TT-NN
Install Metalium [Y/n] 
```

:::{admonition} Optional
:class: note
This container possesses a release installation of tt-nn and tt-metalium. **If you want if you want to use tt-nn / tt-metalium to build software, answer “Y” to this question”, otherwise, answer “N”.**
:::

### **4\. Install TT-Metalium Model Demos Container**
Next, you will be prompted whether to install the TT-Metalium Model Demos container:
```
[INFO] Would you like to install the TT-Metalium Model Demos container?
[INFO] This container is best for users who need more TT-Metalium functionality, such as running prebuilt models, but it's large (10GB)
Install Metalium Models [Y/n] 
```
:::{admonition} Optional
:class: note
This container possesses a full build of the [tt-metal](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/tree/main) project, including model demo source code.
**If you want to run model demos answer "Y" to this question", otherwise, answer "N".**
:::

### **5\. Choose Python Package Installation Location**
Next, you will be asked to select how you would like to install Python packages. Our software is distributed in many forms, one of them being Python packages. We provide four installation options:
```
[INFO] How would you like to install Python packages?
1) active-venv: Use the active virtual environment
2) new-venv: [DEFAULT] Create a new Python virtual environment (venv) at /home/$USER/.tenstorrent-venv
3) system-python: Use the system pathing, available for multiple users. *** NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU ARE SURE ***
4) pipx: Use pipx for isolated package installation
Enter your choice (1-4) or press enter for default (new-venv): 
```
**If this is your first time running tt-installer, we recommend using the second, DEFAULT option.**

### **6\. Install System Software Dependencies**
Next, tt-installer will install:
* [TT-KMD](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-kmd), the Kernel-Mode Driver
* [TT-Flash](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-flash), the utility to flash firmware blobs to Tenstorrent devices
* [TT-Firmware](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-firmware), the on-device firmware
* [HugePages](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-system-tools), a system tool for improving memory performance
* [TT-SMI](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-smi), the System Management Interface

### **7\. Reboot System**
:::{admonition} Important
:class: warning
At the end of the installation process, you will be prompted to answer this question:
```
[INFO] Would you like to reboot now?
```
**You must answer "Y" if this is your first time running tt-installer on your system.**
:::

---

## **Verify System Software Installation**
After rebooting your system, verify all system software dependencies were successfully installed and loaded. This section will introduce you to the [tt-smi](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-smi) tool, which we'll use to enumerate all Tenstorrent devices.

First, activate the Python environment in which you installed the required Python packages. You performed this environment selection in [Step 5. Choose Python Package Installation Location](#5-choose-python-package-installation-location).
:::{note}
If you selected the DEFAULT option which installs all Python packages under `/home/$USER/.tenstorrent-venv/bin/activate`. Execute this command to activate the Python virtual environment:
```bash
source ~/.tenstorrent-venv/bin/activate
```

If you did not, use the installation path you chose in [step 5](#5-choose-python-package-installation-location). 
:::

Next, execute this command to start tt-smi, then ensure the number of devices listed under the **"Device Information"** pane matches the number of Tenstorrent devices installed in your system:
```bash
tt-smi
```

Here is an example of what you should see for a system containing a single p150a device:
![](tt_smi_screenshot.png)

:::{admonition} Important
:class: danger
If the number of listed devices does not match what you expect, please [contact support](#need-additional-support) and we will assist you.
