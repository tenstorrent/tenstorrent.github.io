# Software Setup

Once your Tenstorrent hardware is physically set up, you'll need to follow these steps in this order to update the firmware and install the necessary utilities.



## Install Driver

### Prerequisite

You must have DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) installed. In the terminal, enter the command appropriate to your Linux distro.

| Linux Distro           | Command                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Debian, Ubuntu         | `apt install dkms`                             |
| Fedora                 | `dnf install dkms`                             |
| Enterprise Linux based | `dnf install epel-release && dnf install dkms` |

### Installation

Install the driver (**[TT-KMD](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-kmd)**) by entering this series of commands in the terminal:

```{code-block} bash
:substitutions:
git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-kmd.git
cd tt-kmd
git checkout -b ttkmd-{{ver_kmd}} ttkmd-{{ver_kmd}}
sudo dkms add .
sudo dkms install tenstorrent/{{ver_kmd}}
sudo modprobe tenstorrent
```

## Install TT-Flash

To install **[TT-Flash](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-flash)**, the utility used to update firmware, enter this command in the terminal:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-flash.git
```



## Update Firmware

To update the firmware for your Tenstorrent card, enter this series of commands in the terminal:

{{ instructions_fwbundle }}
```{code-block} bash
:substitutions:
wget https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-firmware/raw/main/fw_pack-{{ver_fw}}.fwbundle
tt-flash flash --fw-tar fw_pack-{{ver_fw}}.fwbundle
```

If this process worked, reboot the system and go to the next section. 

If running this last command results in an error that says the firmware is too old, enter the following command:

```{code-block} bash
:substitutions:
tt-flash flash --fw-tar fw_pack-{{ver_fw}}.fwbundle --force
```

Then reboot the system.



## Install Software Management Interface (TT-SMI)

Install the Tenstorrent Software Management Interface (**[TT-SMI](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-smi)**) by entering this command in the terminal:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-smi
```

 

## Run Software Management Interface (TT-SMI)

Run the TT-SMI tool by entering the command in the terminal:

```
tt-smi
```

If the tool runs without error, you're ready to get started! 

 

## First 5 Things to Do

Now that your Tenstorrent Tensix Processor(s) up and running, there are two SDKs you can work with to familiarize yourself with the hardware and associated utilities and software. Each SDK lists five tasks to start with.

- [First 5 Things](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-buda-demos?tab=readme-ov-file#first-5-things-to-do) for **TT-Buda**, our open source, high level SDK
- [First 5 Things](https://tenstorrent.github.io/tt-metalium/latest/get_started/get_started.html) for **TT-Metalium**, our open source, low level SDK
